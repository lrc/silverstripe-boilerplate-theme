This folder should contain un-minified javascript libraries direct from the vendor. It should remain possible to update 
these libraries by simply replacing the folder with a new distribution from the vendor.

Vendor javascript is minified and combined appropriately for production use by Grunt. See `Gruntfile.js` in the root 
folder of the theme.

## Libraries
